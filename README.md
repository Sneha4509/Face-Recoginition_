# Face Recognition and find missing face list Project
A browser-based app demonstrating the application of Face Recognition technology.
This web app acknowledges all the people living in a town. The app will help the officials make a list of how many people were
previously living in it and how many are missing in case of a natural disaster. It will achieve its goal by using face recognition and notifying the  names of all the missing persons with high accuracy. The app uses the latest version of HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript along with face-API and the sift algorithm to recognize faces.
